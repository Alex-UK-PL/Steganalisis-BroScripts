1428104397.552984	Reporter::WARNING	The analyzed trace file was determined to contain only TCP control packets, which may indicate it's been pre-filtered.  By default, Bro reports the missing segments for this type of trace, but the 'detect_filtered_trace' option may be toggled if that's not desired.	/opt/bro/share/bro/base/misc/find-filtered-trace.bro, line 48
